          This Reliquary Expedition unit spends most of their time in the field, returning to Silvermoon for well deserved breaks and to catch up on the latest rumours - always an ear to the ground for their next acquisition. But what do they do?
    </p>
    <p>
    It’s all about the dig!
    </p>
    <p>
    The various Examiners, Scouts, and Support team that make up this Reliquary Expedition Group are ones who savour the feeling of dirt in their hands. From the initial attempts to locate an artifact, right through to returning the most powerful items to the High Kingdom, every member of this team compliments their ability to excavate and protect artifacts with their own unique specialisations.
    </p>
    <p>
    From the mages who trace the magical signatures, deciphering ancient texts, and warding their people and finds; to the scouts and outrunners who’s eyes and ears hear about the most treasured and secretive items; through to the protectors who ensure the safety of their team - these members are hand picked to join because they all have one thing in common….
    </p>
    <p>
    They love the dig.
    </p>
    <p>
    They’re often found accompanying other units to far flung corners of Azeroth. Sharing their camp with a variety of friends and allies - building the relationships that serve them well and offering their unique talents in return.
